**<h3>Projects</h3>**

**Project 1: PopUp Cookies**

This project showcases a simple implementation of a popup cookies functionality on a web page. When a user visits the page, a modal popup will appear at the bottom of the screen, informing the user about the use of cookies on the site and giving them the option to accept or decline the use of cookies.

**Project 2: Text-Animations**

Text-Animation is a simple project that demonstrates how to create text reveal animations using JavaScript. With just a few lines of code, you can create eye-catching effects that will make your website or application stand out. This project is perfect for anyone looking to learn more about web animations or improve their front-end development skills. Check out the live demo to see Text-Animation in action, and feel free to fork the project and customize it to your liking.

**<h3>Contributing</h3>**

Contributions to these animation projects are welcome and encouraged! If you have an idea for a new project or an improvement to an existing one, please feel free to submit a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.
