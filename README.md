**Project 1: PopUp Cookies**

This project showcases a simple implementation of a popup cookies functionality on a web page. When a user visits the page, a modal popup will appear at the bottom of the screen, informing the user about the use of cookies on the site and giving them the option to accept or decline the use of cookies.
